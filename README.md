## 🛠️ Projects & Contributions

Here you'll find:

- 🔍 OSINT & recon tools/scripts  
- ⚙️ Automation for bug bounty & recon workflows  
- 📊 Learning repos for TryHackMe / HTB / LeetCode  
- 🧪 Custom payloads, cheat sheets & more  

### 🔧 Featured Projects

#### 1. 🕵️‍♂️ StegTool  
A comprehensive command-line tool for image steganography. Easily hide and extract secret messages using various steganographic techniques. Built with modular support to add custom methods with ease.

#### 2. 🌐 SubEnum  
A Bash script that automates subdomain enumeration, live target detection, and recon using popular tools. Designed for quick reconnaissance with just one command.

**Features:**
- Subdomain Enumeration via 8+ tools (`subfinder`, `sublist3r`, `knockpy`, etc.)
- Live Target Detection using `httprobe`
- Reconnaissance:
  - Screenshots via `EyeWitness`
  - Technology detection via `WhatWeb`
- Single-command execution with auto-saved results

---

#### 3. 🛡️ Web Application Firewall (Custom Proxy-Based)  
Developed a secure web application with an integrated proxy acting as a basic WAF (Web Application Firewall). Hosted the main application on port `5000` and the proxy on port `5001`. All traffic is routed through the proxy, allowing logging and security enforcement.

**Key Highlights:**
- Input validation and sanitization against XSS, SQLi, and injection attempts  
- Custom-built proxy server for traffic filtering  
- Traffic logs for security auditing  
- Enforces secure coding best practices
