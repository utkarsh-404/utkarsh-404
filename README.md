#### [2. 🦅 IntelHawk](https://github.com/utkarsh-404/IntelHawk)  
Advanced OSINT Reconnaissance Web Application
A modular, beginner-friendly, and powerful toolkit for cybersecurity professionals, bug bounty hunters, and researchers.

**Features:**
🔎 Subdomain Enumeration (via Sublist3r)
🌐 Network Scanning (via Nmap)
📄 WHOIS Lookup (via python-whois)
📧 Email Harvesting (via theHarvester)
🧠 Technology Detection (via WhatWeb)
📍 IP Geolocation (via IP-API)
🔐 Breach Check (via Breach-Checker)
🧬 Malware Scan (via VirusTotal API)

#### [3. 🛡️ Web Application Firewall (Custom Proxy-Based)](https://github.com/utkarsh-404/WAF)  
Developed a secure web application with an integrated proxy acting as a basic WAF (Web Application Firewall). Hosted the main application on port `5000` and the proxy on port `5001`. All traffic is routed through the proxy, allowing logging and security enforcement.

**Key Highlights:**
- Input validation and sanitization against XSS, SQLi, and injection attempts  
- Custom-built proxy server for traffic filtering  
- Traffic logs for security auditing  
- Enforces secure coding best practices
